Description: set of small function to be used with SS
						For example, biological reference points, such as Fmsy, F0.1, F%SPR etc can
						be calculated
						2011/03/28 export(getReport and calcFAA)
						2011/04/02 updated plotComps.lattice
						2011/04/12 many updates including plotComps.lattice summarySS makeCPUEfit
						2011/04/14 Adapted multiple season recruitments
						2011/04/16 Add Pearson residual plots of length/Age comps by year
						2011/04/16 Corrected an coding error when calling makeCPUEfit from summarySS. 
						           Previously makeCPUEfit always read a file "report.sso" in current working directry
						2011/04/17 Level plot of Pearson residuals was corrected to plot missing cell as blank 
						2011/04/18 Corrected several errors in do.boot

						2011/04/21 Minor updates
						2011/04/27 To make compatible with 3.21a etc
						2011/05/02 core part of calcFAA was rewritten

						2011/05/24 fixed a bug in calFAA.ypr (0.96)
						2011/06/02 To chnage to load doSMP, foreach later(0.97)
						2011/06/05 Update to make compatible with SS 3.21d (0.971)
						2011/06/05 To put dimnames in faa.array in calcFAA etc (0.972)
						2011/06/07 Add new option nyears.Floss to calcBRP 
						2011/06/08 Export getFmort.ypr, getFmort.ypr0
						2011/06/09 calcFAA.ypr was exporesed
						2011/06/09 Corrected a coding error
						2011/07/11 Compiled with 2.13.1 and made compatible with SS3.21d
						2011/11/04 Compiled with 2.14.0
						2011/11/04 Export checkSSversion
						2011/11/20 compiled with 2.14.0 with command R CMD INSTALL --build -l .\\temp ss.utils
						2011/11/22 modified calcSPR

						2012/03/07 Recovered NAMESPACE
						2012/04/06 Fixed YPR calculation, Recompiled with 2.15.0
						2012/04/07 Fixed SPR calculation and MSY estimation
